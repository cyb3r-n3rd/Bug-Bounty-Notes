If got a Ftp server of a website and files are not downloading then
bypass it with the null filter =>
xyz.com/ftp/file.bak%2500.pdf // it download the desired file into pdf

In love with SSRF through reverse proxy misconfiguration. Got almost 25 SSRFs in 3 4 days.
Methodology:
1. Identify any reverse proxy, like(nginx, cloudfront etc)
(18 subdomains/targets were using nginx)
2. Change Host: <targer> to burp-collab
3. If it loads burp-collab response
Try accessing localhost/cloud instance

When you upload image on target, always check if website exif data is leaking any sensitive data

1. Upload image on <Target>

Bug: Google Maps Api Key Disclosure with Lack of Security Configurations
#bugbountytip: i used secretfinder tool to find sensitive data like apikeys, accesstoken, s3-bucket, etc in JavaScript files.
if you found the key then use gmapscanner tool for determining whether a leaked/found Google Maps API Key is vulnerable to unauthorized access by other applications or not.

Writeup:
https://lnkd.in/d_4WSFR


Instead of alert (document.domain) to popup for xss try to access tokens 
Like 
alert(localStorage.getItem('access_token'))
May be u can get something, I hope.
